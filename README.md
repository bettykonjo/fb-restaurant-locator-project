# Project Title: fb-restaurant-locator-project , by Frankie Avina and Betelihem Hayle @ 2022.

# This Restaurant Locator app that  loads Yelp restaurant data for a diffirent location (State), and shows this data both as restaurant list items and as pushpins on a Leaflet map. A user can then click on individual restaurants to be directed to that restaurant's details page, or choose instead to search for restaurants in a new location.This app  firmed up by using our existing knowledge of the React basics (components, JSX, props, event handling, using forms, making API calls, basic hooks) and also utilize newer skills like handling styles using styled-components and conditionally rendering components using react-router-dom.
